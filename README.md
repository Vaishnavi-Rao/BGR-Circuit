# BGR-Circuit
Design of CMOS Bandgap Circuit with High PSRR
A voltage reference is a crucial block in many advanced mixed-signal applications. The most commonly used reference implementation is the Bandgap reference
due to its high predictability, low dependence on supply voltage and temperature
variations. It is used in various low voltage applications and can be economically
implemented in CMOS process
The project employs a current mode architecture that improves the temperature stability
as well as the power supply rejection when compared to the conventional voltagemode bandgap reference circuits and analyse the different blocks - Startup and Power
Circuit , BGR Core (with opamp) to achieve the required end result. In this project,
Iâ€™ve designed the BGR in 180nm CMOS process technology and the simulations
are performed in Cadence Virtuoso simulator.
